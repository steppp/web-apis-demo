This repository contains come demos to try out some web APIs which run in the browser. The code is divided into different projects, each one in its own folder.

## List of projects

- **Fullscreen animation**: an animation that progresses as the scroll does exploiting the Animations API.

- **Parallax**: simple parallax effect on different elements using CSS rules only.

- **Linear gradient**: simple gradient text which gradually changes colors and whose orientation follows the mouse
