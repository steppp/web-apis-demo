# WEB APIS DEMOS

This repository contains come demos to try out some web APIs which run in the browser. The code is divided into different projects, each one on its own folder.

## List of projects

- **Delayed cursor**: a basic example on how a delayed cursor animation could be implemented. This first version is very rude and has just basic and simple funcionalities.

- **Fullscreen animation**: an animation that progresses as the scroll does exploiting the Animations API.
